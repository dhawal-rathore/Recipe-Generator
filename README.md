# Recipe Generator


## Project Description
This project was created to provide recipe suggestions to the user depending on the ingredients they have. It will also
track the recipes it has generated over a set period of time to reduce repetitions, and will also be able to generate 
shopping lists if you plan your meals in the future. 

This project was designed to be used by anyone, especially if they're too busy to plan out meals for the week, or are
indecisive and cannot decide what they want for dinner. I chose this project because planning out what I want to eat
takes me a significant amount of time when I have to check if I have all the ingredients I need for a dish, and if I
don't I need to find something else to make. This process gets repetitive for everyone, and this program should make it 
easier for the user to plan their next meal.
